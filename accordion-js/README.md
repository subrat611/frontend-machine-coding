# Design and Implement an Accordion Component

## Requirement

- Create an accordion that has at least 3 sections (expandle/collapsible).
- The active section should be visually distinct (e.g., background color, border, or icon).
- Implement the solution using clean and redable code.

### Bonus

- Implement a default section that will expand on the initial page load.
- Consider scalability and discuss how you might handle adding more accordions or content section dynamically.

## Interview tip:

- Before writing code, talk about your plan clearly like how you structure componets, props, states etc.
